⚡ Fun fact: I am a boring archive worker who try to learn coding while working with dusty pile of papers.

This is my first program. 
With this project I tried to find a solution to calculate the lenght of the archives that I currently work on. 
We use mostly four types of boxes and these boxes have different lenghts.
When we try to calculate the length we need to calculate the lenght type by type of the boxes.
It took a bit of time and of course could lead a bunch of msitakes and we definetely don't want that.
So basicly I wrote this program to solve this issue.
Jsut enter the numbers and magicly the lenght has been calculated. 
When I wrote it I use TKinter and Pillow for design and easily convert to .exe format. (It wasn't easy at all.)
I shared the main python file and the .exe file in case if you do not want to mess with pyinstaller.
Tips and quastions are very welcome!
Not bad for first program eh?
